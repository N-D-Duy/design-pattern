# Observer Pattern Example: Event Notification to Followers

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the Observer Design Pattern, which defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. The example includes a user system where followers get notified of events or updates from users they follow.

## Structure

- **Subject (`User`)**: The object that holds the state and notifies observers of changes.
- **Observer (`Follower`)**: The interface that defines the update method for objects that should be notified of changes in the subject.
- **Concrete Subject (`User`)**: A concrete implementation of the `Subject`.
- **Concrete Observer (`Follower`)**: A concrete implementation of the `Observer`.
- **Client (`Main`)**: Creates the subject and observers and demonstrates the notification mechanism.
